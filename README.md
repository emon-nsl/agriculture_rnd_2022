Paper: An automated fruit harvesting robot by using deep learning. <br>
Published data: 2019 <br>
contribution:  A highly fast and accurate method with a Single Shot MultiBox Detector is used to detect the position of fruit, and a stereo camera is used to detect the three-dimensional position then calculate angles of the joint. The robot arm is moved to the target fruitâ€™s position. The robot then harvests the fruit by twisting the hand axis. The experimental results showed that more than 90% of the fruits were detected.
Algorithm: <Model architecture with visualization image>
Dataset: Custom made dataset
Accuracy: 90%
