# Paper 1

Paper: An automated fruit harvesting robot by using deep learning. <br>

Published data: 2019 <br>

contribution:  A highly fast and accurate method with a Single Shot MultiBox Detector is used to detect the position of fruit, and a stereo camera is used to detect the three-dimensional position then calculate angles of the joint. The robot arm is moved to the target fruitâ€™s position. The robot then harvests the fruit by twisting the hand axis. The experimental results showed that more than 90% of the fruits were detected. <br>

# Paper 2
Paper: A Real-time Low-cost Artificial Intelligence System for Autonomous Spraying in Palm Plantations

Published data: 06 April 2021

contribution: Optimized YOLOv3 and named it Ag-YOLO which is competetive with YOLO-Tiny with very low power consumption and disk space to detect palm trees and spray accordingly.

# Paper 3

Paper: Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA) Solution Underpinned by Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Published data: 05 May 2019

contribution: A servay paper brifing how can AI/ML and IoT help in Agriculture with least human involvement. Smart management system which will take inputs from different sensors, cameras and process these Inputs using AI/ML to get optimized output.

Irrigation: Getting input through sensors and irrigate right amount of water

Insecticide Spray: Uisng visual cues to get where to spray reduces great deal of insecticide usage.

Harvesting: AI/ML to detect which collect only the riped one.

Fertilizer: Using sensor data to predict which neutrition is needed and make a fertilizer to reach 
the need. Which will reduce the use of fertilizer.

Monitoring: Monitoring vast field is cumbersome and sometimes impossible. But AI powered drone can do it with much ease.

# Paper 4

Paper: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Operated Pesticide Sprayer

Published data: 04 April 2022

contribution: Made a specialized moving object and get images through camera and using those data predict detect if it has any defect. and If it has, then spray insecticides.

Algorithm: Gaussian Naive Bias to classify if it is affected.

Dataset: Custom made dataset

# Some Brainstorming Ideas
- Custom fertilizer for every chunk of plot
- Mechanical weed removal
- Making pods of vertical agriculture for indoor small farming
- Sattelite imaging for crop amount prediction
- Supershop, restaurants, resort, retail food waste reduction
